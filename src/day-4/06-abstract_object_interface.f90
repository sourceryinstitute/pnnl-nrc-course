module object_interface
  !! Define an abstract object type and type-bound procedure interface bodies to
  !! 1. Prevent declarations of this type (becuase it's not useful on its own).
  !! 2. Facilitate deferring the definition of some bound procedure to the
  !!    non-abstract child types and providing a specification for the abstract 
  !!    interface that each non-abstract child's procedure bindings must support.
