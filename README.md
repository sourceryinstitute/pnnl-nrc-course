* A new virtual machine is available at www.sourceryinstitute.org/store with 
  - GCC 10.1.0 in the PATH
  - OpenCoarrays 2.9.1
  - ford fixed
  - Geany integrated development environment (IDE) installed

If you're using the original virtual machine downloaded before 7/20/2020,
you can install Geany by typing the following command in a terminal window
```bash
sudo apt install geany
```
and enter your account password.  If you're using the virtual machine guest
account and haven't changed the password, then the password is "U-Guest-It"
